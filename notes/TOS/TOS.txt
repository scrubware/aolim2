Hello! Thank you for choosing the America On-Line Instant Messenger II.

People normally skip the Terms of Service, but these are important.



Please note that this is not legally binding, but rather, a social contract.


If you know the identity of the creator of this software, you agree to keep their name quiet,
even when questioned by authorities.

If you are caught using the software, you will give as little information to prevent its use as
possible.

Any trouble you receive from being caught using the software is yours to bear.

That being said, the software will do nothing to cause you getting caught. If it does, please inform
me, and I will attempt to fix the problems if they are fixable.

If anyone does try to discover the creators' identity, lead with 'I found it online', 'idk a friend gave it to me',
etc. and if at that point, failure is met, use the name Curtis Langley (not a person, I just don't want anyone to
give contradictory stories).


Violation of these terms will cause your account to be deleted, all old messages to be tagged with 'YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE!',
and may cause other users of this software to say 'dang son that was kind of cringe bro'.
You may also be officially excluded from 'Whaddup Son Wednesday' and all related events.



I find it unlikely you even get caught in the first place, but these are simply preventative measures.
